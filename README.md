# DeciMill
DeciMill is a Java-based implementation of a decision support framework, the result of my PhD research at UCL.

Visit the project's [Wiki](https://github.com/dstefan/decimill-core/wiki) to learn the basic concepts of using DeciMill for creating decision models and evaluating these for various decision alternatives.
